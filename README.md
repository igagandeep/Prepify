# Prepify

Prepify is an open-source web application built to help job seekers manage their job search in a simple and focused way. The goal of the project is to bring common job preparation tasks into one place without unnecessary complexity.

The application currently focuses on three core areas: tracking job applications, analyzing resumes against job descriptions, and practicing interviews using AI.

## Features

### Job Tracking
Track job applications including company name, role, application date, and current status.

### Resume Analysis
Compare your resume with a job description to identify missing skills and areas for improvement.

### AI Mock Interviews
Practice mock interviews with AI in a low-pressure environment to improve confidence and readiness.

This project is in early development and features are being built incrementally.

## Project Goals

The main goals of Prepify are to reduce the stress of job preparation, eliminate the need for multiple disconnected tools, and provide a clean and professional experience.

This is an open-source project and is intended to evolve over time with community input.
