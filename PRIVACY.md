# Privacy Policy — Prepify Chrome Extension

**Last updated: February 2026**

## Overview

Prepify is a free, open-source job tracking tool. This privacy policy applies to the Prepify Chrome Extension ("the Extension").

## Data Collection

The Extension reads the content of job posting pages (such as job title, company name, and location) solely to pre-fill the Prepify job tracking form. This data is:

- **Never sent to any external server**
- **Never stored in the cloud**
- **Never shared with third parties**
- Only sent to your own locally running Prepify application at `localhost:5000`

## What We Access

| Data | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Job title, company, location | Pre-fill the add job form |
| Current page URL | Detect if the page is a supported job posting |

## What We Do NOT Collect

- Personal identifiable information (name, email, address)
- Browsing history or web activity
- Authentication credentials
- Financial or payment information
- Any data transmitted to external servers

## Local Storage Only

All job application data saved through the Extension is stored exclusively in a local SQLite database on your own machine. Prepify does not operate any cloud service or remote database.
